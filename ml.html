But now you have machines that can learn on their own. From Siri or Alexa to self-driving cars! This is possible because of machine learning. These self-learning, interactive machines that not only assist but also do tasks independently. They learn from and perform better over time. (Siri and Alexa giving you suggestions and those cars knowing better with each time about which turns to take and so on. It is as if they have the ability to think. And that is the goal. </span>
